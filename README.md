# An Invesitigation of the Travelling Salesman Problem

## Overview

This project will be an exploration and comparison of different methods used to solve or attempt to solve, the travelling salesman problem (TSP). The TSP is a classic optimization problem where the goal is to find the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the starting city. This project will compare the nearest neighbour algorithm, Held-Karp algorithm, simulated annealing, and (maybe) ant colony optimization.

## Nearest Neighbour Algorithm

This algorithm chooses the closest city as the next one to visit until every city has been visited and it returns to the starting city.
